/**********************************************************************
  Module: player.h
  Author: Daniel Rea

  Purpose: manages the player's ship for invaders
  cut down from my solution to distribute as sample framework code

  Use this to get an idea of how to add things as part of the game.
  Feel free to use any of this freely in your solution, or change or modify
  this code.

  Some functions unimplemented, just to show how I roughly went about things.
